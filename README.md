# The String Harmony - Code samples

Here are code samples from two complicated levels in my online riddle
[The String Harmony](https://thestringharmony.com/). The code samples are just
for reference purposes, and are completely **NOT** related to solving the levels.
To avoid spoilers, many of the level details have been removed/modified.
Please do not use these samples for solving.

## Level descriptions

- `quantum`: An interactive level that simulate the process of quantum teleportation
using the website and Discord. Two players need to form a team to manipulate "qubits"
with quantum gates, respond to automated Discord messages,
and finish tasks about quantum teleportation in limited time. As an outcome,
players can learn the basics of quantum teleportation through solving puzzles.

- `portal`: A metapuzzle being parody to the famous game Portal. Using `.htaccess` tricks,
players use a portal to travel between different "universes" - alternate versions of the website.
They need to collect hints scattered in universes to solve a wide range of puzzles, including
classic ciphers, image and audio processing, steganography and forensics, web exploitation, and
esoteric programming languages. Different universes affect each other,
and puzzles/hints are unlocked as players make progress in one universe.
